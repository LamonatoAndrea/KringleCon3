# Writeup for SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2020 - 'Zat You, Santa Claus? featuring KringleCon 3: French Hens
# 10. Defeat Fingerprint Sensor
## 10.0. Description
Bypass the Santavator fingerprint sensor. Enter Santa's office without Santa's fingerprint.
##10.1. Solution
To solve this objective I operated the santavator the same as [Objective 4](../04), just by specifying the proper floor:
```javascript
var targetFloor = 3;
$.ajax({
  type: 'POST',
  url: POST_URL,
  dataType: 'json',
  contentType: 'application/json',
  data: JSON.stringify({ 
    targetFloor,
    id: getParams.id,
  }),
  success: (res, status) => {
    if (res.hash) {
      __POST_RESULTS__({
        resourceId: getParams.id || '1111',
        hash: res.hash,
        action: 'goToFloor-' + targetFloor,
      });
    }
  }
});
```

## 10.3. ...actually‚Ä¶
Actually I‚Äôve spent some time thinking why this objective looked so straightforward to me‚Ä¶ I mean, could it simply be the same, identical, solution of another objective? So I did my homework and landed on your [github](https://github.com/CounterHack/HolidayHack2020/issues/36). Now I know‚Ä¶ how many ‚Äúwrong‚Äù solutions did I collect so far? 3 out of 11? I‚Äôm proud of them and I‚Äôll never correct them anyway üòÅ

## 10.2. Because sometimes root is not the way
