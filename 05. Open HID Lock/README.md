# Writeup for SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2020 - 'Zat You, Santa Claus? featuring KringleCon 3: French Hens
# 5. Open HID Lock
## 5.0 Description
Open the HID lock in the Workshop. Talk to Bushy Evergreen near the talk tracks for hints on this challenge. You may also visit Fitzy Shortstack in the kitchen for tips.
## 5.1. Side Challenge - Speaker UNPrep
The aim of the challenge is to overcome passwords within three executables: `door`, `lights` and `vending-machines`.  
Regarding the `door` executable, the password was contained as a plaintext string within it so the `strings` command made it to password `Op3nTheD00r`:  
```bash
elf@73ec330920b2 ~ $ ls 
door  lab  lights  lights.conf  vending-machines  vending-machines.json
elf@73ec330920b2 ~ $ strings door | grep -i password
/home/elf/doorYou look at the screen. It wants a password. You roll your eyes - the 
password is probably stored right in the binary. There's gotta be a
Be sure to finish the challenge in prod: And don't forget, the password is "Op3nTheD00r"
Beep boop invalid password
elf@73ec330920b2 ~ $ ./door 
You look at the screen. It wants a password. You roll your eyes - the 
password is probably stored right in the binary. There's gotta be a
tool for this...

What do you enter? > Op3nTheD00r
Checking......

Door opened!
```
The `lights` executable relies on the `lights.conf` configuration file with fields `name` and `password`. It’s execution leads to the hint that some decryption of these fields was being performed. Switching the values in the lab made the trick, causing the executable itself to print the decrypted content of the password `Computer-TurnLightsOn`:
```bash
elf@73ec330920b2 ~ $ cat lights.conf 
password: E$ed633d885dcb9b2f3f0118361de4d57752712c27c5316a95d9e5e5b124
name: elf-technician
elf@73ec330920b2 ~ $ cd lab
elf@e725d14b2eb0 ~/lab $ cat lights.conf 
name: E$ed633d885dcb9b2f3f0118361de4d57752712c27c5316a95d9e5e5b124
password:
elf@e725d14b2eb0 ~/lab $ ./lights 
The speaker unpreparedness room sure is dark, you're thinking (assuming
you've opened the door; otherwise, you wonder how dark it actually is)

You wonder how to turn the lights on? If only you had some kind of hin---

---t to help figure out the password... I guess you'll just have to make do!

The terminal just blinks: Welcome back, Computer-TurnLightsOn

What do you enter? > 
Checking......
That would have turned on the lights!

If you've figured out the real password, be sure you run /home/elf/lights
elf@e725d14b2eb0 ~ $ ./lights 
The speaker unpreparedness room sure is dark, you're thinking (assuming
you've opened the door; otherwise, you wonder how dark it actually is)

Checking......

Lights on!
```
`vending-machine` relies on `vending-machines.json` configuration file and gives the hint to remove it. Removing it in the lab the executable recreates it, and inserting the same character more times it was possible to determine that the encryption was a basic polyalphabetic substitution and that the length of the key was 8 chars. At that point I just ran the executable with all printable ASCII characters and then decrypted the original password string `LVEdQPpBwr` to `CandyCane1`:
```bash
elf@1fb6c9052b21 ~/lab $ ./vending-machines

you can hear them complaining about the turned-off vending machines!

## 5.2. Hints
> **What's a Proxmark?** - Bushy Evergreen: *“The Proxmark is a multi-function RFID device, capable of capturing and replaying RFID events.”*  
> **Short List of Essential Proxmark Commands** - Bushy Evergreen: *“There's a short list of essential Proxmark commands also available.”*  
> **Impersonating Badges with Proxmark** - Bushy Evergreen: *“You can also use a Proxmark to impersonate a badge to unlock a door, if the badge you impersonate has access. lf hid sim -r 2006......”*  
> **Reading Badges with Proxmark** - Bushy Evergreen: *“You can use a Proxmark to capture the facility code and ID value of HID ProxCard badge by running lf hid read when you are close enough to someone with a badge.”*  
> **Proxmark Talk** - Bushy Evergreen: *“Larry Pesce knows a thing or two about HID attacks. He's the author of a course on wireless hacking!”*  
## 5.3. Tools
The Proxmark3 was available as a separate console within the items:
![proxmark](imgs/00_proxmark.png)
## 5.4. Solution
I went around the map and executed Proxmark reading badges near various elves:
