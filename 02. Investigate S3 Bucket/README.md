# Writeup for SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2020 - 'Zat You, Santa Claus? featuring KringleCon 3: French Hens
# 2. Investigate S3 Bucket
## 2.0. Description
When you unwrap the over-wrapped file, what text string is inside the package? Talk to Shinny Upatree in front of the castle for hints on this challenge.
## 2.1. Side Challenge - Kringle Kiosk
The objective was to escape a menu and launch /bin/bash. The 4th option of the menu suggested that special characters may lead to errors, so I tried a command injection with ;/bin/bash and it worked.  
```bash
```
## 2.2. Hints
> Leaky AWS S3 Buckets - Shinny Upatree: “It seems like there's a new story every week about data exposed through unprotected Amazon S3 buckets.”
> Finding S3 Buckets - Shinny Upatree: “Robin Wood wrote up a guide about finding these open S3 buckets.”
> Santa's Wrapper3000 - Shinny Upatree: “Santa's Wrapper3000 is pretty buggy. It uses several compression tools, binary to ASCII conversion, and other tools to wrap packages.”
> Find Santa's Package - Shinny Upatree: “Find Santa's package file from the cloud storage provider. Check Josh Wright's talk for more tips!”
> Bucket_finder.rb - Shinny Upatree: “He even wrote a tool to search for unprotected buckets!”
## 2.3. Solution
Reminding also the name of the tool itself (Wrapper3000), out of some thoughts and luckiness I added some words to the wordlist:
```
  package
  wrapper3000
  kringlecon
  santa-wrapper-3000
```
I ran `bucket_finder.rb` with the updated and the `-d` option, ending up retrieving a base 64 encoded file which was actually a zip file. Multiple extractions, some string operations, an `xxd` and other extractions leaded to the `package.txt` file with content:
`North Pole: The Frostiest Place on Earth`
The full output of what I ran in the terminal is available at this link.
## 2.4. Interesting facts
There is an entire challenge dedicated to AWS vulnerabilities, which includes S3 buckets issues. Kudos to http://flaws.cloud/!
