# Writeup for SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2020 - 'Zat You, Santa Claus? featuring KringleCon 3: French Hens
# 6. Splunk Challenge
## 6.0. Description
Access the Splunk terminal in the Great Room. What is the name of the adversary group that Santa feared would attack KringleCon?
## 6.1. Side Challenge - Sort-O-Matic
The challenge is about using the right regexes to sort toys. Below the ones I used:

6.2. Hints
Adversary Emulation and Splunk - Minty Candycane: ‚ÄúDave Herrald talks about emulating advanced adversaries and hunting them with Splunk.‚Äù
Data Decoding and Investigation - Minty Candycane: ‚ÄúDefenders often need to manipulate data to decRypt, deCode, and refourm it into something that is useful. Cyber Chef is extremely useful here!‚Äù
Splunk Basics - Minty Candycane: ‚ÄúThere was a great Splunk talk at KringleCon 2 that's still available!‚Äù
6.3. Solution

QUESTION
SOLUTION
TRAINING QUESTIONS
1. How many distinct MITRE ATT&CK techniques did Alice emulate?
QUERY:
  | tstats count where index=* by index 
  | rex field=index "(?<macro>t.*?)[.-]" 
  | dedup macro 
  | count dc(macro)

RESPONSE: 13
2. What are the names of the two indexes that contain the results of emulating Enterprise ATT&CK technique 1059.003? (Put them in alphabetical order and separate them with a space)
QUERY:
  | tstats count where index=* by index
  | search index="*1059.003*"

RESPONSE: t1059.003-main t1059.003-win
3. One technique that Santa had us simulate deals with 'system information discovery'. What is the full name of the registry key that is queried to determine the MachineGuid?
QUERY 1:
  | tstats count where index=* by index
  | search index="*1082*"

QUERY 2:
  index="t1082-win" "MachineGuid" 
  |  dedup CommandLine
  |  table CommandLine

RESPONSE: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography
4. According to events recorded by the Splunk Attack Range, when was the first OSTAP related atomic test executed? (Please provide the alphanumeric UTC timestamp.)
QUERY:
  index=attack OSTAP 
  | sort +"Execution Time _UTC" 
  | table "Execution Time _UTC"

RESPONSE: 2020-11-30T17:44:15Z
5. One Atomic Red Team test executed by the Attack Range makes use of an open source package authored by frgnca on GitHub. According to Sysmon (Event Code 1) events in Splunk, what was the ProcessId associated with the first use of this component?
EXTERNAL RESOURCES: T1123.md, AudioDeviceCmdlets

QUERY 1:
  index=attack t1123

QUERY 2:
index=* EventID=1 EventData_Xml=*audio* 
| sort +SystemTime 
| table CommandLine, process_id 
| head 1

RESPONSE: 3648
6. Alice ran a simulation of an attacker abusing Windows registry run keys. This technique leveraged a multi-line batch file that was also used by a few other techniques. What is the final command of this multi-line batch file used as part of this simulation?
QUERY:
  index=attack reg
  |  stats count by atk, field3

COMMENT: Ok, I actually gave up on this question so I worked out my alternative path. I knew it had something to do with the Atomic Red Team repository and a bat file. I cloned the github repo and extracted the last line of each bat file then submitted them until i found quser was the right one, sorry üòÅ

RESPONSE: quser
7. According to x509 certificate events captured by Zeek (formerly Bro), what is the serial number of the TLS certificate assigned to the Windows domain controller in the attack range?
QUERY:
index=* sourcetype="bro:x509*" "certificate.issuer"="CN=win-dc-748.attackrange.local" 
|  dedup certificate.subject
|  table certificate.subject, certificate.serial

CHALLENGE QUESTION
What is the name of the adversary group that Santa feared would attack KringleCon?
INPUTS FROM ALICE BLUEBIRD: 
This last one is encrypted using your favorite phrase! The base64 encoded ciphertext is:
7FXjP1lyfKbyDK/MChyf36h7
It's encrypted with an old algorithm that uses a key. We don't care about RFC 7465 up here! I leave it to the elves to determine which one!
I can't believe the Splunk folks put it in their talk!

EXTERNAL RESOURCES: RFC 7465, Dave Herrald, Adversary Emulation and Automation | KringleCon 2020, RC4 Cipher

FAVORITE PHRASE:


SHELL:
thedead@dellian:~$ echo "7FXjP1lyfKbyDK/MChyf36h7"| base64 -d | xxd | cut -d " " -f2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 | tr -d "\n" | tr -d " " && echo 
ec55e33f59727ca6f20cafcc0a1c9fdfa87b

DECRYPTION:
Decrypted using the RC4 Cypher from dcode.fr with input ec55e33f59727ca6f20cafcc0a1c9fdfa87b and key Stay Frosty

RESPONSE: The Lollipop Guild
6.4. T-Shirts and Stickers
I actually have this splunk t-shirt and sticker, love them!
