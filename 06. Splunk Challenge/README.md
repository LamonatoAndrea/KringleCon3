## 6.2. Hints
> **Adversary Emulation and Splunk** - Minty Candycane: *‚ÄúDave Herrald talks about emulating advanced adversaries and hunting them with Splunk.‚Äù*  
> **Data Decoding and Investigation** - Minty Candycane: *‚ÄúDefenders often need to manipulate data to decRypt, deCode, and refourm it into something that is useful. Cyber Chef is extremely useful here!‚Äù*  
> **Splunk Basics** - Minty Candycane: *‚ÄúThere was a great Splunk talk at KringleCon 2 that's still available!‚Äù*

## 6.3. Solution
### 6.3.0. TRAINING QUESTION 1 
1. How many distinct MITRE ATT&CK techniques did Alice emulate?
```bash
  | tstats count where index=* by index 
  | rex field=index "(?<macro>t.*?)[.-]"

### 6.3.5. TRAINING QUESTION 6
6. Alice ran a simulation of an attacker abusing Windows registry run keys. This technique leveraged a multi-line batch file that was also used by a few other techniques. What is the final command of this multi-line batch file used as part of this simulation?  

*Ok, I actually gave up on this question so I worked out my alternative path. I knew it had something to do with the Atomic Red Team repository and a bat file. I cloned the github repo and extracted the last line of each bat file then submitted them until i found quser was the right one, sorry üòÅ*

### 6.3.6. TRAINING QUESTION 7

### 6.3.7 CHALLENGE QUESTION
What is the name of the adversary group that Santa feared would attack KringleCon?
> Alice Bluebird: *This last one is encrypted using your favorite phrase! The base64 encoded ciphertext is: `7FXjP1lyfKbyDK/MChyf36h7`*  
> Alice Bluebird: *It's encrypted with an old algorithm that uses a key. We don't care about RFC 7465 up here! I leave it to the elves to determine which one!*  
> Alice Bluebird: *I can't believe the Splunk folks put it in their talk!*  

EXTERNAL RESOURCES: [RFC 7465](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7465), [Dave Herrald, Adversary Emulation and Automation, KringleCon 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVgEFt08kU), [RC4 Cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rc4-cipher)
